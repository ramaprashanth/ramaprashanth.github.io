# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

An Engineer pursuing to conceive free will :heart: in robots :robot:. 

I'm possibly the most positive person :innocent: on the face of Earth :earth_americas:. I love building things and you can always find me working on a challenging idea :bulb: ! My pursuit of happ'y'ness :angel: is when folk interact, feel happy, one in themselves, trustworthy with technology in their hands :gift:. The addictive adrenaline rush you get when the product you build enables others' lives is what drives me :rocket: !

Moreover, I’m an adventurer :surfer: in constant pursuit of finding out who I am. I strongly believe that who we are is much more than who we see in front of a mirror, where we are from, what we are made of, what we do and what we think. My core quality is I’m a quick and passionate learner. I have become engrossed with the idea "Learn as if you were to live forever" :mortar_board: and this is the fuel that keeps our torch of life burning. Over the years I've been fortunate to have learned so much and met awesome gem of people leading me to realize that passion is highly inflammable :fire: .
