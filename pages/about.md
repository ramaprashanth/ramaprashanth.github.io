# **About Me**

An Engineer pursuing to conceive free will :heart: in robots :robot:. 

I'm possibly the most positive person :innocent: on the face of Earth :earth_americas:. I love building things and you can always find me working on a challenging idea :bulb: ! My pursuit of happ'y'ness :angel: is when folk interact, feel happy, one in themselves, trustworthy with technology in their hands :gift:. The addictive adrenaline rush you get when the product you build enables others' lives is what drives me :rocket: !

Moreover, I’m an adventurer :surfer: in constant pursuit of finding out who I am :grey_question: . I strongly believe that who we are :performing_arts: is much more than who we see in front of a mirror :dancer: , where we are from :house: , what we are made of :partly_sunny: , what we do :moneybag: and what we think :thought_balloon: . My core quality is I’m a quick and passionate learner :mortar_board:. I have become engrossed with the idea "Learn as if you were to live forever" :hourglass: and this is the fuel that keeps our torch of life burning :volcano: . Over the years I've been fortunate :pray: to have learned so much and met awesome gem of people leading me to realize that passion is highly inflammable :fire: .
