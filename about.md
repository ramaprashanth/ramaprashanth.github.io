# **About Me**

Fine, I'll admit it. I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>

I'm an Engineer pursuing to conceive free will in robots.

I'm possibly the most positive person on the face of Earth. I love building things and you can always find me working on a challenging idea. My pursuit of happ'y'ness is for people to interact, feel happy, one with and trustworthy with technology in their hands. The addictive adrenaline rush you get when the product you build enables others' lives is what drives me.

Moreover, I’m an adventurer in constant pursuit of finding out who I am. My core quality is I’m a quick and passionate learner. I have become engrossed with the idea "Learn as if you were to live forever" and this is the fuel that keeps our torch of life burning. Over the years I've been fortunate to have learned so much and met awesome gem of people leading me to realize that passion is highly inflammable.
